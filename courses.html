          <h2>Class 9</h2>
          <p>
            Class 9 is an important stage where a student needs to focus on
            his/her subjects as they form a base for higher classes. The whole
            curriculum is changed and is completely different from Class 8. Here
            students get advanced Mathematics where topics like Algebra,
            Geometry and Mensuration are highly focused on. In Science, students
            have Physics, Chemistry and Biology as different subjects. Thus, the
            syllabus gets more complicated and it is very important for students
            to keep their concepts clear. <br /><br />
            We at Studymate help students to prepare for Class 9 by our expert
            faculty. We provide students with the best study material based on
            CBSE norms. Here students are well-prepared for their upcoming
            examinations and are taught accordingly. Each topic is revised
            thoroughly so that it lasts in the student’s memory for long and
            they can score well in their examinations. Weekly, monthly and
            quarterly tests are conducted to keep a check on the student’s
            performance. We aim at focusing on each individual and enhance their
            learning experience.
